        <p class="post-meta">Posted on: October 28, 2025</p>

        <p>In a landmark decision that has sent tails wagging across the academic community, Ziggy, chief morale officer for the lab, has been awarded the prestigious "Cutest Doggo of the Year" award. This award, presented by the National Association for Canine Companions in Science (NACCS), recognizes the invaluable contributions of furry friends in high-stress research environments.</p>

        <h2>A Surprising Win</h2>
        
        <p>The competition was fierce, with nominees from labs across the country. Ziggy's nomination highlighted his key skills in "advanced napping," "stress-reduction-cuddles," and "proficient-crumb-detection."</p>

        <p>Witnesses say his acceptance speech was brief but moving, consisting mainly of a happy sigh and a request for belly rubs. Dr. Kuempel has stated that the lab is "immeasurably proud" and that the award "will be placed on the mantel, right next to the squeaky toys."</p>
