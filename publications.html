Focusing on the combined economic, human health and wellbeing impacts across linked watersheds and reef areas can motivate action and leverage investment that result in co-benefits across multiple sectors. Designing appropriate solutions, therefore, requires taking a multi-sector, systems approach, that accounts for both social and ecological systems, with collaboration required across environmental, agricultural, public health, and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) sectors, and across the land-sea interface.",

            "abstract": "Australia is a net importer of seafood, with imports making up approximately 70% of total seafood consumption. Relying on imports can create challenges for ensuring seafood sustainability, as imported products may come from fisheries or aquaculture operations with varying levels of sustainability practices and regulations. In this study, we explore the sustainability challenges faced by import-dependent nations like Australia and propose strategies to enhance the sustainability of imported seafood.",

Our analysis reveals that half of these aquaculture sites are located near important shorebird habitats, underscoring the need for integrated management approaches to balance aquaculture development and shorebird conservation.",
